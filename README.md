# API Prometheus
This is an API made for the Mobile Programming 2 class. This is the first API I made and it introduced me to this new world. This project was made by a team of three people led by me. This API was made for a fictitious store that sells sportswear called Prometheus.

## Description

This project was developed with Javascript, Node.js and Express. It is used to store sports apparel and store sales in a MySQL database. The Postman tool was used to make calls to the API and test it.

This API is connected to two mobile applications that this same team made with React Native. The first app is for the customer, where he or she can make product purchases, and the second app is for the store associate, who can add new products, replenish inventory, and delete or modify items on sale. . Here are the links to the other repositories:

- [Mobile employee app](https://github.com/Bryanmartz972/ProyectoMovil2ReactEmpleado)

## Installation

To install the project on the computer, clone the repository or download the .zip folder and extract it to any other folder. Once you have the project, in the Visual Studio Code terminal or in another terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
  npm i
  npm run dev
```

Also to test the project you have to import the file "proyectomovil2.sql" located in the root folder of the project to MySQL Workbench. Additionally, you have to change the database connection lines in the src/configs/db.js file.

With all this done, you can use the API
